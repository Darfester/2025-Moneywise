        <h2>Recognizing Phishing Scams</h2>
        <p>
          Phishing scams are deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information,
          such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data, by
          impersonating legitimate entities. Recognizing these scams is
          essential to avoid falling victim to them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inspect Email Addresses: Pay close attention to the sender's email
            address.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be Cautious of Urgent Requests: Scammers often create a sense of
            urgency to pressure you into taking immediate action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hover Over Links: Before clicking on links in emails or messages,
            hover your mouse cursor over them to see the actual URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify Requests: If you receive an email requesting sensitive
            information or payment, independently verify the request.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Strong Passwords</h2>
        <p>
          Strong passwords play a pivotal role in protecting your accounts from
          unauthorized access. Creating and managing strong passwords involves
          several strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Length and Complexity: Opt for passwords that are at least 12
            characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase
            letters, numbers, and special symbols.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid Predictable Patterns: Refrain from using easily guessable
            patterns like "123456" or "password."
          </li>
          <li>
            Passphrases: Consider using passphrases â€“ longer combinations of
            words or sentences that are memorable to you but difficult for
            others to guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unique Passwords: Use unique passwords for each of your online
            accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Password Management Tools: To manage multiple strong passwords,
            consider using a password manager.
          </li>
