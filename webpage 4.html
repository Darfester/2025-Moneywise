        <h2>Fundamentals of Investing</h2>
        <p>
          Investing involves committing money with the expectation of earning a
          return or profit over time. Here are the core principles of investing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Time Horizon: Consider your investment goals and how long you plan
            to invest.
          </li>
          <li>Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with risk.</li>
          <li>
            Diversification: Spread your investments across different asset
            classes and industries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inflation Consideration: Investing can potentially help your money
            grow at a rate that outpaces inflation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Different Investment Options</h2>
        <p>
          There are various investment options available based on financial
          goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Some common options
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stocks: Stocks represent ownership in a company. By buying shares of
            a company's stock, you become a shareholder and can potentially
            benefit from price appreciation and dividends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or
            corporations. When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money
            to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the
            return of your principal at maturity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to
            invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other
            securities. They offer diversification without the need for
            individual stock or bond selection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Similar to mutual funds, ETFs also
            provide diversification. They trade on stock exchanges and offer
            flexibility to buy and sell throughout the trading day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Real Estate: Real estate investment involves purchasing properties
            to generate rental income or capital appreciation. Real estate can
            provide diversification beyond traditional securities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commodities: Investing in commodities involves buying physical goods
            like gold, silver, oil, or agricultural products. Commodities can
            act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Concept of Risk and Return</h2>
        <p>Risk and return are fundamental concepts in investing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Risk: Risk refers to the uncertainty associated with an investment's
            potential for losses.
          </li>
          <li>Return: Return is the profit generated from an investment.</li>
