        <h2>Credit Scores</h2>
        <p>
          A credit score is a numeric representation of your creditworthiness,
          condensing your credit history into a single number that lenders use
          to assess your risk as a borrower.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Credit Score Ranges:</strong> Credit scores typically range
          from 300 to 850. A score above 700 is generally considered good, while
          a score above 800 is excellent. Lower scores may lead to challenges in
          obtaining credit or loans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Credit Score Factors:</strong> Various factors influence your
          credit score, each with a different level of importance. These factors
          include payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), length of
          credit history (15%), types of credit (10%), and new credit (10%).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Credit Reports:</strong> Your credit score is based on
          information in your credit reports from major credit bureaus like
          Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. It's important to regularly review
          your credit reports for errors or discrepancies that could affect your
          score.
